## Development and Credits

This project was made using [php](https://www.php.net/), [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/). Without these pieces of software, alot of this would've never been made.

If you would like to contribute, fork it! I doubt anyone wants to touch this dumpster-fire of a codebase but if you feel like it, go ahead!
You can find useful information in the [docs](docs/index.md). I'm an idiot and make all my own tools, which is why they suck and are a confusing mess.
