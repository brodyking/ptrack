## Definition 

Scripts are very similar to [modules](modules.md), only difference is that they are only used to store backend code, mostly for the [API](api.md).

## Locations
These are the locations of the scripts, script sources, their functions, and more.

| Location | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `/scripts/scripts.json` | Where all scripts are defined |
| `/scripts/scripts.php` | Where all script functions are defined |
| `/scripts/source/` | Where all script source files are kept |

## Usage
This section is a tutorial on how to create and use scripts.

### Creating Scripts

All scripts are defined in `scripts/scripts.json`, and all source code for each scripts is stored in `scripts/source/`. Here is an example script:

```json
"example": {
    "name": "example",
    "description": "what the script does",
    "version": 1.0,
    "author" : "your name",
    "source": "modules/source/NAMEOFSCRIPT.php"
}
```

If you havent noticed, this is the exact same syntax as a module.

You will create a file for your script in the source directory, and specify its path in the json file. 

**You NEVER leave anything outside of a function, besides variables. All code that is to be run should be put inside of a function**

### Accessing Scripts

Scripts are accessed in various ways. 

| Function | Parameters | Returns |
| -------- | ---------- | ------- |
| `scriptsGet()` | `$name` | The source directory path. |

To use a script, you have to include it. Here is an example:
```php
include scriptsGet("nameofascript");
```
