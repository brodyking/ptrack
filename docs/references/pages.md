## Definition 

Pages, similar to [modules](modules.md), are segments of code that are written once to be used in multiple places. However, unlike modules, they are written in `html`.

They are kept in the `/pages/` directory. 

Static elements that do not require php should be put in pages. You can also put pages inside modules using the methods listed below.


## Accessing Pages 
A page can be added by using `include`. This is the recommended way.
```php
include "pages/PAGENAME.html";
```
Because these are static, you can also use `file_get_contents()` in conjunction with echo.
```php
echo file_get_contents("modules/PAGENAME.html");
```
