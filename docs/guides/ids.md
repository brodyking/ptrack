## Introduction
*Ids* are the system for authentication on ptrack. It is a simple, "if it isnt *that* broken, then dont fix" implementation. A new auth system will be developed later down the road.

## The Concept
When a user logs in, a unique int will be assigned. This is put into the site url as a `$_GET[]` param.
